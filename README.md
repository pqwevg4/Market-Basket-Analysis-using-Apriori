# Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm

## Overview
This project applies **Market Basket Analysis** on a **grocery dataset** to uncover **association rules** between purchased items. The **Apriori algorithm** is used to identify frequent itemsets and generate actionable insights, such as product bundling and recommendations.

## Key Features
- Uses **Apriori Algorithm** for identifying frequent itemsets
- Extracts **association rules** to find strong relationships between products
- Cleans and preprocesses transactional data
- Visualizes results for easy interpretation

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, mlxtend)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Dataset**: Retail transactions (Groceries)

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy mlxtend
```

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pqwevg4/Market-Basket-Analysis-using-Apriori.git
   cd market-basket-analysis
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook and run [Market_Basket_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/pqwevg4/Market-Basket-Analysis-using-Apriori/blob/main/Market_Basket_Analysis.ipynb).
3. The output will display frequent itemsets and association rules.

## Steps in the Notebook
1. **Loading Data**: Reads a grocery transaction dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and prepares data for analysis.
3. **Applying Apriori Algorithm**: Extracts frequent itemsets.
4. **Generating Association Rules**: Identifies product relationships.
5. **Interpreting Results**: Insights into product recommendations.

## Applications
- **Retail & E-commerce**: Recommending product bundles
- **Marketing Strategies**: Targeted promotions based on frequent purchases
- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Stocking products based on buying patterns
